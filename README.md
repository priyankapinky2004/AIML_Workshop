1. ‚úÖ **Simple Linear Regression**

   - Predict house price based on square footage.
   - Includes coefficient, intercept, R¬≤ score, and graph.

2. ‚úÖ **Multiple Linear Regression**

   - Predict house price using multiple features (area, bedrooms, age).
   - Uses multivariate inputs and outputs prediction + score.

3. ‚úÖ **Decision Tree Classifier**

   - Classification using Decision Tree on a medical dataset.
   - Visualized with `plot_tree()` from sklearn.

4. ‚úÖ **Random Forest Classifier**

   - Ensemble model using multiple decision trees.
   - Includes model accuracy and prediction on test data.

5. ‚úÖ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Classification using Breast Cancer Dataset.
   - Explores linear kernel and evaluates performance.
